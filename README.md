# Byaml-Tool
A simple byaml tool which currently just converts endianness using Syroot's Byaml Library 

This will eventually be a full byaml editor but some will find this function useful to use other byaml programs with little endian byaml files.

Credit to Syroot for the fantastic byaml library which helps build and create these formats.
